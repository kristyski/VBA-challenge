Week 2-VBA Homework

This amazing collection of stock data, including daily open and close prices, could be used to determine a single stocks performance over three years. Or perhaps this is your portfolio and you are looking at how it as a whole performed over three years.

The code I have prepared for you today, when run, calculates the net change from the last closing price of the year minus the first opening price of the year, per stock.
Then, there is a formula run to determine the percent change for each stock. And finally, the volume per stock is totaled in the last column.

Cell formatting is done to indicate positive (green) and negative (red) net changes, plus I added a red text format to the negative numbers in the percent change column.
I added some headers and bolded them.
And that's about it.
